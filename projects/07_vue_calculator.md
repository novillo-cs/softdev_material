## VUE project: Calculator

You must create a simple calculator using HTML, Vue.js and CSS.

Create a repo and branches to work with your partner. Please add the teacher as collaborator.

### Calculator Features:

- Your calculator should have the same functionalities as the Basic calculator you have in Mint. You do not need to worry about the other modes.

- The user can click on the calculator numbers or use the keyboard. If the user, type non-numeric keys you must let the user know that is an invalid value.

- You must implement the "Undo" button.

### Requirements:

- You must use Vue.js. Do not use pure JS.

- Your Vue code should include these sections: data, methods, watch, computed properties.

- You must submit HTML, JS and CSS files. Also, you must include a log: You and your parter will log the tasks you worked on after each time you worked on the project (including issues you had) which means the log should include a date. I do not want to see a single line by student making a summary of what you did. I want to see what you did every day. Penalty will be applied if the log does not follow the direcions I am asking for this project.

```Example:

2/29 - John: I worked on updating the CSS with VUE. I had a JS bug when refreshing the display field. I solved that issue by creating a new event...
```
