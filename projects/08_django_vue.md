You must create a simple application using Django, Posgres, Vue.js, HTML, CSS (optional).

Create a repo and branches to work with your partner. Please add the teacher as collaborator.

Notice that you must dedicated time outside the classroom to work on this project.

### Specifications:

- Use Django to implement the backend.
- Use Posgres database.
- Use Vue.js for the frontend.
- Use GitHub branches.
- CSS is optional.

### Requirements:

- Implement user authentication. The user needs to be logged in to use your website.
- Design and implement a small database. You must submit your database diagram (Entity Relationship Diagram). It should be uploaded to your GitHub repo.
- Implement more than one Vue.js app. For instance, you can have one Vue.js app for each page in your website. The main menu could be done in Django with a template, unless you want to challege yourself and try to do it with Vue.js.
- Make POST and GET request from Vue.js to Django.
- Implement a Vue form where one field depend on another one. (example: load data in a multiselect based on a previous field selection)

- You must submit the Django project, Vue.js project and a log.txt file: You and your parter must log the tasks you did after each time you work on the project (including issues you had) which means the log should include a date. I do not want to see a single line by student making a summary of what you did. I want to see what you did every day. Penalty will be applied if the log does not follow the directions I am asking for that file. Please log if your partner is absent. If you are absent you need to work at home to make up your classwork. Otherwise, it would not fair for your partner.

```Example:

2/29 - John: I worked on updating the CSS with VUE. I had a JS bug when refreshing the display field. I solved that issue by creating a new event...
2/29 - Sophie: Absent.
```

### Important:

Everyone should have a branch to work. If you do not have a branch, I cannot see your contributions to the project, so I will not have any evidence to grade your work, so your grade will be affected.
