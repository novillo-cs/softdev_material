## Mini project: Dice Game -  Going to Boston

You must work on this project with a partner. The pair must not have worked together in the two previous projects.

You are going to implement a dice game: Going to Boston. (https://theop.games/blogs/theop/10-fun-and-easy-dice-games-to-play) 

Animation is NOT required. You may represent a dice with just a number displayed on the web page. OPTIONAL: Once you are done with the JS code, you may add some CSS and/or an image (of a dice) instead of just the number. 

I will grade your JavaScript code. I will NOT grade CSS.

### Game Features:

- Your game must be a two-player game. 

- Before starting the game, ask the user to fill in a text input field with the number of rounds that should be played (it should be an odd number). Then, the user clicks on start the game. At that moment, the round text input is disabled (until the user starts a new game).

- The players should roll the dice to decide who goes first. You may have a button to roll the dice. If both players get the same number, they should roll the dice again.

- In each round, the players have to roll the dice three times (the first time, the three dice, then two dice, and finally one dice). Keep the count of round wins for each player.

- At the end of the game, the winner should be displayed on the webpage.

### What should be displayed on your game web page?

Make the HTML elements static. On your web page, you must display the following info: 

- Player 1 and Player 2 with their current score on the current round and how many rounds the player has won.
  
- The dice and a button to roll them.
  
- Game info: total rounds, how many rounds have been played, current round data.

- Restart/Start button.
