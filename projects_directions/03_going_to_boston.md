## Mini project: Dice Game -  Going to Boston

You must work on this project with a partner. The pair must not have worked together in the two previous projects.

You are going to implement a dice game: Going to Boston. (https://theop.games/blogs/theop/10-fun-and-easy-dice-games-to-play) 

Animation is not required. OPTIONAL: Once you are done with the JS code, you may add some CSS.

Make the HTML elements static. Make the dice look like a number. OPTIONAL: If you have extra time, add an image (of a dice) instead of the number.

### Game Features:

- Your game must be a two-player game. 

- Before starting the game, ask the user to fill in a text input field with the number of rounds that should be played (it should be an odd number). Then, the user clicks on start the game. At that moment, the round text input is disabled (until the user starts a new game).

- The players should roll the dice to decide who goes first. You may have a button to roll the dice. If both players get the same number, they should roll the dice again.

- In each round, the players must roll the dice three times (the first time, the three dice, then two dice, and finally one dice). Keep the count of round wins for each player.

- At the end of the game, the winner should be displayed on the webpage.
