## BMI Calculator

Two friends, Mark and John want to compare their BMIs. Let's use objects to implement the calculations! Remember: BMI = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meters).

**Your tasks:**

- For each of the friends, create an object with properties for their full name, mass, and height (Mark Miller and John Smith). Name these objects as mark and john, and their properties exactly as fullName, mass and height.

- Create a calcBMI method on each object to calculate the BMI (the same method on both objects). Assign the BMI value to a property, and also return it from the method.

- Log to the console who has the higher BMI, together with the full name and the respective BMI. Example: "John Smith's BMI (28.3) is higher than Mark Miller's (23.9)!".

TEST DATA: Marks weighs 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weighs 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.

## Tip Calculator

Let's improve the tip calculator we implemented in class, this time using loops!

Your tasks:

- Create an array called bills containing all 10 test bill values.

- Create empty arrays for the tips and the totals (tips and totals)

- Use the calcTip function we wrote before (included in the starter code) to calculate tips and total values (bill + tip) for every bill value in the bills array. Use a for loop to perform the 10 calculations!

- Write a function calcAverage which takes an array called arr as an argument. This function calculates the average of all numbers in the given array. This is a DIFFICULT challenge (we haven't done this before)! Here is how to solve it if you feel like it. Call the function with the totals array.

TEST DATA: 22, 295, 176, 440, 37, 105, 10, 1100, 86, and 52.
