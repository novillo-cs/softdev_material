Based on the example provided:

* Create at least 5 of your tables in your database using pgAdmin (the database could be the one in lisa or in you own devices). The tables should have primary key, foreign keys (if any), unique and non-unique indixes (if any). 

* Make a select query for each table getting all the data.

* Make a select query for each table including a filter (where).

* Make at least 3 join queries to get the data from your database. Use left and right joins to see the diferences.

Execute those queries in pgAdmin and then copy/paste them in the file sql_commands_queries.txt (md or pdf)
