1. Create a dataframe with the followind data:

```
data = {"mammal": ["African Elephant", "Bottlenose Dolphin", "Cheetah", "Domestic Cat", "Giraffe", "Ground Squirrel", "Horse", "House Mouse", "Human", "Killer Whale", "Lion", "Pig", "Rabbit"],
        "life_span": [70, 25, 14, 16, 25, 9, 25, 3, 80, 50, 15, 10, 5],
        "hours_of_sleep": [3, 5, 12, 12, 2, 15, 3, 12, 8, 3, 20, 8, 11],
        "speed": [40, 37, 110, 50, 50, 19, 69, 13, 45, 48, 80, 18, 56],
        "diet": ["plants", "meat", "meat", "meat", "plants", "both", "plants", "both", "both", "meat", "meat", "both", "plants"]
    }
```

2. Prints the hours of sleep column

3. Prints the mammal and hours of sleep columns

4. Stores the mammals and hours of sleep columns in a variable

5. Prints the sleep_data for mammals who sleep exactly 8 hours

6. Prints the sleep_data for mammals who sleep less than 4 hours

7. Prints the sleep_data for mammals who sleep exactly 8 hours OR less than 4 hours

8. Prints the mammals dataframe using the mammal column as the index

9. Stores the table consisting of only the hours of sleep in a variable ```sleep_data```

10. Prints the ```sleep_data``` for mammals who sleep less than 4 hours
