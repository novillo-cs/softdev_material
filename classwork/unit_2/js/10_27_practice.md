## Tip Calculator

Let's implement a tip calculator. If the bill value is between 50 and 300, the tip is 15% of the bill. And if the value is different, the tip is 20%.

**Your tasks:**

- Write a function calcTip that takes any bill value as an input and returns the corresponding tip, calculated based on the rules above.

- And now let's use arrays! So, create an array called bills containing the test data below.

- Create an array called tips containing the tip value for each bill, calculated from the function you created before.

- Create an array totals containing the total values, so the bill + tip.

**TEST DATA:** 125, 555, and 44.
